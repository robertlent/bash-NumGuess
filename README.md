# Bash Number Guess

Bash Number Guess is a Bash number guessing game.

The user is asked to choose a difficulty, resulting in a 1-5 digit random number, i.e. difficulty 1 results in random number from 1-9, difficulty 5 results in a random number between 10000-99999.

The user's lowest number of guesses and highest completed difficulty will be saved between runs, as long as the created file 'score' exists and is not altered.

### Requirements
The application requires the Bash Shell, so will not natively run on Windows. After downloading and unzipping the files, you can then run the command './guess.sh' from inside of the unzipped folder.
